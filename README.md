# 16StonesBot
CapstoneProject for Spring of 2022
When setting up add command line code:
  npm install discord.io winston â€“save.
  
  and 
 
  npm install https://github.com/woor/discord.io/tarball/gateway_v6
  
  There is also a python version of the bot. In order to use the python version the uploader needs to install
  
    pip install discord.py
    and 
    pip install python-dotenv
    
   you will also need to make a .env file that is in the same folder as bot.py
   when running the bot, the game file Stones.py needs to be in the same folder as the bot.py file in order for the import of the game code to the bot to work.
  
  this allows bot to be altered and edited
